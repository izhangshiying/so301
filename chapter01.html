<p style="text-align: center";>Unremarkable</p>
<blockquote cite="du.101.camp">
    Hundreds of years have passed,
    An astouding world has been shaped.
    Though what people keep in hand,
    is merely dozens of years.
    Live indifferently and talk indifferently,
    seldom understand how the world works,
    and almost lack of awarness of the time.
    What an unremarkable life with anonymous mute acceptance.

    万物更新,
    人寿十载.
    异口同声,

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Comments of Bear, May 2020</strong></p>
<p>This material introduces a full picture of sociology. Sociology is about human response especially irony response. In fact, most of people still live in neolithial age, not even dark age. Though several people have lived a civilize and modern life with security. The world is full of choas and stiffness. Very littel things have changed. That's why we need to keep a cosmopolitan attitude towards life.</p>

<p><q>While the net result of these developments over many hundreds of years would be equally astounding, the slow rate at which they occurred would have made them unremarkable. That is, they would not have been noticeable enough in the experience of any one person's lifetime to draw their attention and suggest remarking upon. In fact, even across the experience of many generation's lifetimes there would be no appreciable change in the way people lived their lives, no difference in what they understood about the world and how it worked, so that between people who would share their experience of the world and pass it on to others there would be little difference and no debate.</q></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Afghan-American writer, Tamin Asary, 2002</strong></p>
<p><q>In 1948, when I was born, most of Afghanistan might as well have been living in Neolithic times. It was a world of walled villages, each one inhabited by a few large families, themselves linked in countless ways through intermarriages stretching into the dim historical memories of the eldest elders. These villages had no cars, no carts even, no wheeled vehicles at all; no stores, no shops, no electricity, no postal service, and no media except rumors, storytelling, and the word of travelers passing through. Virtually all the men were farmers. Virtually all the women ran the households and raised the children. Virtually all boys grew up to be like their fathers and all girls like their mothers. The broad patterns of life never changed, never had as far as any living generation could remember, and presumably never would. People lived pretty much as they had eight thousand years ago.</q></p>




<p><q>That was the countryside. The big cities, such as Kandahar and Mazar-i-Sharif, were living in the fifteenth century or so.  And the biggest city, Kabul, where my family lived, had made it to the twentieth century, but just barely. Cars were few, roads were unpaved, and public transportation consisted mostly of gadis--horse-drawn, two-wheeled carriages. Electricity was scarce, too. Most of us used kerosene lanterns at night. There was no running water. We had wells. There was no garbage service. We didn't produce any garbage. Hundreds of thousands of people lived in the city, but the houses had no numbers and the streets had no names. </q></p>

<p><q>Simultaneously disruptive and liberating, this paradoxical experience encourages an appreciation of irony—that things are never exactly as we might think they are, that unanticipated consequences are more the norm than the exception, that even our own intentions are not entirely trustworthy—that something else is always going on.</q></p>
